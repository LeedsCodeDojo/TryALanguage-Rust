Rust is a systems programming language developed by Mozilla.
It is designed to be a "safe, concurrent, programming language", and aims to support multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, and embedded systems.

Rust's idea of safety is an extremely central aspect of the language, and influences all aspects of building systems with Rust.
This is accomplished via a very powerful type and memory management system, which guarantees at compile time that your code is memory safe, and has no data races, null pointers, or use-after-free errors.

We'll learn some of the basics of Rust, including data handling, concurrency, and data safety.

Attendees should install Rust before the session (via https://www.rustup.rs/ is the official method)
